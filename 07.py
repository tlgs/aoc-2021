"""Day 6: The Treachery of Whales

Algorithm:
    The derivative of |x| is sign(x).
    âˆ‘ sign(yi - x) equals zero only when the number of positive numbers equals
  the number of negative numbers; this happens when x = median{y1, y2, ..., yN}.
    See <https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1024462> for a good description.

    Second part was just a naive brute-force approach by identifying that
  fuel(|y - x|) = T(|y - x|) = (|y - x| * (|y - x| + 1)) / 2.
    Here, T(n) is the nth _triangular number_.
    See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number>.
